BindingCalculator (aka SamplePrepCalculator)
====================

This folder contains a version of the binding calculator
used with the PacBio RS and PacBio RS II sequencers. It is used to
calculate binding and annealing reactions and to prepare DNA samples
for use in these sequencers.

For more information, please refer to the calculator section in the
Customer Training Slide set posted in the portal.


Installation
------------
To download this version of the binding calculator,
use the ZIP button to download a zip file containing this README 
file, a RELEASENOTES file describing changes between versions, 
as well as a single-file version of the calculator named
Calculator.html

1. Copy the Calculator.html file to a location on your computer
like your Desktop, Applications or your Documents folder. 
2. Then double click
on that file to launch the calculator in your browser.


Browser Compatibility
---------------------
The recommended web browsers to use with the Binding Calculator
are Firefox browser and Chrome browser.  Safari browser, including 
mobile Safari, will also work although we have not tested it as 
extensively.

Opening Calculator.html in Chrome and Safari will always show the 
list of old calculations. Opening a new version of Calculator.html 
in Firefox will show old calculations only if the location of the 
new version of Calculator.html is placed in the same location as 
the old version of Calculator.html. If a new location is used, 
Firefox will show a fresh (blank) list of calculations.
